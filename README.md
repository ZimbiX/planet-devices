# planet-devices

Repository for Planet Computers devices. Use this for feature requests, bugs, and *constructive* feedback. 

As a interim measure, I (@shymega) setup this issue tracker to later be maintained officially by Planet Computers, for the community to report bugs/issues, provide feature requests, and give constructive feedback.

However, I must stress that the frustration felt by many in the PC community should be avoided here. I want this tracker to be a constructive medium, and repetitive posts on how the Astro or other devices are delayed will be removed. We need to be positive. It will come.

Respect and politeness are a must. No one deserves to be personally attacked, or accused of being a Planet 'shill'.

Enjoy!
